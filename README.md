# Some improvements, issues and comments

üëã 

Couple quick comments. This app is obviously not a production ready master piece. I spent a couple hours more then needed, but not enough for production. I have neglected to use react-form, form validators, lots of async error handling and well i test like nothing. For example i use vanilla html form. Why you might ask? I have no used a vanilla html form in years and it was super fun. I even wanted to use document selectors...

There is one big issue with the hydration, which i summarize below. Basically you get an error when refreshing the page. It could be i solved this in the final version if not - please don't refresh the page :(

## Some issues i faced: 
 ‚úçÔ∏è

 - So there is one big issue with using the useAccount hook. The account only updates for mainnet account address. This took me maybe an hour to realize when tweaking the subscription. I made a solution to either use hardcoded account or to have the user input their own account. I opened an issue here: https://github.com/fungible-systems/micro-stacks/issues/162
 - Subscription is hard to test. So the issue here is that the block consolidation rate is every 10 mins+, which makes it really hard for me to test the subscriptions. There are a couple solutions which all take some time: 
  A. I could try to use the send transaction api instead just to check it quicker and it might be that i did do this in the final solution. It's however out of scope for the task.
  B. I could make a unit test for the subscription. Unit tests are not 100% covering for a real scenario, but it's hard to given a 100% coverage to really miss vs the real implementation (why i prefer to test everything).
- BIGGEST issue, there is somethign with the hydration and Next.JS. So Emil kinda told me to just delete a bunch of the code in the beginning, which broke some of the server side hydration stuff. I have looked at fixing this, but the easiest is prblly to skip the server side stuff for now. Why we have Next.js if we skip it however is well ehm well not optimal.

## Improvements

- [ ] TEST TEST TEST. Jest, Mocha, Chai, Tea whatever. Test it.
- [ ] Subscription worked, but really hard to test. Should be revisited
- [ ] Fix hydration issues. Possibly ask author of micro stasks.
- [ ] Build out UI

## Closing thoughts

üîß All in all, it's super cool to see that a BTC L1 can do lots of this DEFI stuff. From looking over the source code of the libraries i can say they are well organized compared to some of the EVM libraries i used in the past. Im generally pretty opimistic towards the quality aspect, we just have to you know BUILD out the ecosystem üõ†
